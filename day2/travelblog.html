        <p><b>A day trip to Chittorgarh from Udaipur.</b></p>
       <li> We spent the time, exploring places of interest around this beautiful city. </li>

       <li>We set off early, seated comfortably in a Tempo Traveller, booked the previous evening.</li>
       <li>Chittorgarh is roughly 115 km from Udaipur, and it takes just over 2 Â½ hours to reach</li>
       <li>It's a comfortable stretch on well-laid National Highways. I mention this, because it's good enough for a road trip, on a bike or car.</li>
