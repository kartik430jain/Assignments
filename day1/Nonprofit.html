        <p>Project 1:</p>
        <li><b>Image Captioning System:</b>Image Captioning is the task of describing the content of an image in words. This task lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Most image captioning systems use an encoder-decoder framework, where an input image is encoded into an intermediate representation of the information in the image, and then decoded into a descriptive text sequence.</li>

        <p>Project 2:</p>
        <li><b>Text Classification :</b>LSTM stands for Long-Short Term Memory. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network but is better than traditional recurrent neural networks in terms of memory. Having a good hold over memorizing certain patterns LSTMs perform fairly better. </li>
